Python Grade Book Instructions

Open the jkrovitz_final_project folder in a Python text editor or IDE of your choice.

To interact with the grade book itself, run the file grade_book.py. From there, it is a user input based program, and the directions on screen will guide the user.

To run the tests, please run the Student.py file. The message "All tests passed!" Will be printed.

The custom_error.py file contains custom error message classes that are used in grade_book.py. Running it will not yield any output.
